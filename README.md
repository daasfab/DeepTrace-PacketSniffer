# DeepTrace

**DeepTrace** is a powerful low-level packet sniffer built by using Python and Scapy. This tool allows you to capture and analyze network traffic in real-time, providing insights into the underlying communication of network protocols.  
*The project is currently in progress and continuously being improved, thus may not work when tested. If this is the case, please report the error to me through my email under my profile page.*

## Features üí°

- Capture packets from a specific network interface.
- Filter captured packets by a target MAC address.
- Display real-time summaries of captured packets.
- Support for filtering packets by protocol (HTTP, TCP, UDP, IP).
- View detailed information about specific packets.
- Automatically detect the default network interface (platform-specific).
- Multithreaded packet sniffing for efficient performance.
- Ability to stop the sniffer after a user-defined duration.


## Requirements ‚öôÔ∏è

To run DeepTrace, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or later
- Scapy 2.4 or later

## Installation üìÇ 
*(Does NOT work yet, please bear with me while I add requirements.txt file and fix errors*  
Follow the steps below to install and set up DeepTrace:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
